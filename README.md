# Best-Pizza-MIPS
A Computer Architecture (ECE250) assignment that reads a file input to identify the most cost-effective pizza one can order, written in MIPS Assembly.

- This assignment was programmed in MIPS and utilizes an insertion sort algorithm to return the list of pizzas in descending order of pizza-per-dollar.
- This algorithm utilizes dynamic allocation of memory to properly sort the given input.
- To mitigate the divide-by-zero situation, if the cost of the pizza is zero, the pizza-per-dollar is simply zero.
